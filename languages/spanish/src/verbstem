; To give the machine learning routines a head start, I just stick a few
; definitions in here. This is needed, because the machine learner can 
; logically not learn more than one morpheme at a time, and a Spanish sentence
; *always* has at least two morphemes.

; So, a verbstem is the infinitive minus the ending -er/-ar.

(for t (transitive intransitive)
(df verbstem
	(theta (subject agent) (object patient))
	(flags .t)
	(segments b e s)
	(seme (head kiss)))

(df verbstem
	(theta (subject agent) (object patient))
	(flags .t)
	(segments m a t)
	(seme (head kill)))
)

; By defining the conjugational affix (or conj-aff for short) for the second 
; person singular, we avoid the problem of ambiguity in the English "you" forms.
; (In other words, if you take this away, you will end up with beses also having
; the meaning of bes√©is, because "you kiss" means both.)
(df conj-aff
	(segments e s )
	(flags present)
	(rection (person second) (number singular)))
