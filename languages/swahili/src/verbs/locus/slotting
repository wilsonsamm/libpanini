; The Swahili verb consists of many "slots", or loci that are each filled with a
; morpheme that encodes some feature. The order of these loci is very rigid.

(df verb
	(call locus negation))


;;;; First up: Negation.
; One minor complication with this is that in the M/WA class singular, and N 
; class animate, some contraction has taken place so that one morpheme has come
; to encode both the negation and the class of the subject.

; first person singular: si- (not *hani-)
; second person singular: hu- (not *hau-)
; third person singular: ha- (not *haa-)

; For this reason, the next locus is flagged with information about whether or
; not the verb is negative. If the verb is not negative, then we call the next
; locus as (call locus subject positive). Otherwise, we (call locus subject 
; negative).

;;; For positive verbs:
(df locus
	(flags negation)
	(seme -negative)
	(call locus subject positive))

;;; For negative verbs:
; (either write "ha" and communicate to the subject that we did so,
;  or do not write "ha" and communicate to the subject that we didn't.)
