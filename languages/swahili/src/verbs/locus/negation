;;;; For positive verbs the situation is simple:
; just make sure that's what we want, and then call the next locus to put the
; subject-prefix in.
(df locus
	(flags negation)
	(seme -negative)
	(call locus subject positive))

;;;; Negation in the indicative and subjunctive.
; This is encoded by a morpheme that sits just ahead of the subject prefix.
; One minor complication with this is that in the M/WA class singular, and N 
; class animate, some contraction has taken place so that one morpheme has come
; to encode both the negation and the class of the subject.

; first person singular: si- (not *hani-)
; second person singular: hu- (not *hau-)
; third person singular: ha- (not *haa-)

; For this reason, the next locus is flagged with information about whether or
; not the verb is negative. If the verb is not negative, then we call the next
; locus as (call locus subject positive). Otherwise, we (call locus subject 
; negative).

;;; For negative verbs:
; (either write "ha" and communicate to the subject that we did so,
;  or do not write "ha" and communicate to the subject that we didn't.)
