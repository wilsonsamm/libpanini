; To add a N-class noun to the dictionary, include these flags:
;      n     - this is N class nounstem
;  countable - this noun is uncountable (always used with singular verb-prefix, like "mvua")
;   animate  - this noun takes M/WA verb-prefix (like rafiki or askari)
;  inanimate - if the noun is not animate, as above, then it should have this flag.
