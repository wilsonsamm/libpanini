; These prefices are functions that call the prefices defined in args/prefices. The reason for this level of abstraction is that 
; it may be necessary to call either a personal prefix (to be instantiated in some scope) or something else (like the reflexive
; infix for example)

(df vprefix
	(flags subject)
	(into (theta subject) constituent prefix subject))

(df vprefix
	(flags object)
	(into (theta object) constituent prefix object)
	(seme (trajectory projective)))
	
(df vprefix
	(flags object)
	(lit ji)
	(seme (trajectory reflexive)))
