; This comment introduces the compiler instruction "segment". Segment matches some underlying phoneme or other element to its
; orthographical representation(s). This is useful because a single morpheme may have dozens of orthographical realisations 
; (depending for example on phonemic environment or spelling standard) but that's no reason to put dozens of definitions in the
; dictionary. 

; That makes a big difference to Nahuatl, which has so many varying spelling standards.
; And English may now define "ize" to surface either as <ise> or <ize> at the end of a word, or <is> or <iz> before a vowel.
; In Greenlandic, high vowels regularly become mid vowel before uvular stops and this is represented in the modern orthography.

; To use this feature, type the "segment" in brackets, following by regular tranny code. Use (underlying ...) to name the underlying
; element, and (surface ...) to give the orthographic representation.

; define the underlying thing and the orthography respectively.
; A (sandhi ...) statement which appears before a (surface ...) statement is bound to the left of the segment;
; A (sandhi ...) statement which appears after a (surface ...) statement is bound to the right of the segment;

; Elsewhere, you can now say:
; (df word
;	(segments n ee saltillo w a tl)
;   (seme (head referential) (person first)))
; Look at the line beginning with (segments ...). This spells <nehuatl>, <nehhuatl>, <nēhuatl>, <nêwał>, etc. etc (the many ways I 
; have seen this spelt), and the way it does that is by listing the names of the underlying segments. 

; These file define two orthographies:
;  - Classical:    This is much like the Spanish orthography. It was introduced by Jesuit missionaries.
;  - Carochi:      This orthography was developed by the famous grammarian; it marks vowel length and the saltillo.
