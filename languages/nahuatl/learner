;   - onset, which may be a consonant, 
;   - nucleus, which must be a vowel, and
;   - coda, which may be a consonant.

; These rules say "A consonant may be b c d l tl kw w p x m etc. etc.". When this rule fires, it consumes that consonant, and adds

; definition that can be added to the source code.)
