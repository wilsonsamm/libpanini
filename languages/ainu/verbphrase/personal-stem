;;; The personal stem is something you can find on pp. 6 - 7 in Causative Constructions in Ainu. It is the verbstem plus any valency
; altering affixes; a sequence of morphemes which is treated as a unit to which the personal-affix attaches.
; To put a new personal stem in, make sure to put one of these flags in:
;    avalent  - the personal stem does not take any arguments.
;  monovalent - the personal stem is monovalent, i.e. takes a single argument (absolutive)
;   bivalent  - the personal stem is bivalent,   i.e. takes two arguments (subject & object)
;  trivalent  - the personal stem is trivalent,  i.e. takes three arguments (subject, object & indirect object)


;; Monovalent personal stems:
; Plain-old monovalent verb
(df personal-stem
	(flags monovalent)
	(function theta monovalent)
	(constituent verbstem monovalent)
	(space))

; bivalent verb with valency reducing operation
(df personal-stem
	(flags monovalent)
	(function theta monovalent)
	(constituent operation valency-reduction)
	(constituent verbstem transitive)
	(space))

;; Bivalent personal stems

; bivalent verb
(df personal-stem
	(flags bivalent)
	(function theta bivalent)
	(constituent verbstem transitive))
