; Particular species of animal. 
; In English, in general, this is normally expressed by some 
; premodifying noun or adjective; these go in this file. If you want to
; add one, put ONE of these flags in:
; whale - this is a species of whale
; duck  - this is a species of duck
; 
; You can also put the "headless" flag in, which means it can also be
; used as a standalone noun. Such is the case with "beluga" or "mallard"
; (you don't need to say "beluga whale" or "mallard duck").
