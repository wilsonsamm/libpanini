; According to the Principles-and-Parameters theory, the surprisingly 
; small amount of syntactic variability among human languages can be
; explained by the so-called Principles, (also known as the Universal
; Grammar), which is parameterised in various ways in various languages.

; These files describe (roughly) how this works. The idea is that 
; eventually we can take advantage of this, and the computer will learn 
; a language in the same way that a human child does. If this works, 
; there will be obvious benefits over a purely statistical system like
; Google Translate or Babelfish.
