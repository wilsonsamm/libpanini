; According to the Principles-and-Parameters theory, the surprisingly small
; amount of syntactic variability among human languages can be explained by the
; so-called Principles, (also known as the Universal Grammar), which is
; Parameterised in various ways in various languages.

; These files describe (roughly) how this works. The idea is that eventually we
; can take advantage of this, and the computer will learn a language in the same
; way that a human child does. If this works, there will be obvious benefits
; over purely statistical models of translation like MOSES...
