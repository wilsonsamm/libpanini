; This comment introduces the compiler instruction "segment". Segment matches
; some underlying phoneme or other element to its orthographical
; representation(s). This is useful because a single morpheme may have dozens of
; orthographical realisations (depending for example on phonemic environment or
; spelling standard) but that's no reason to put dozens of definitions in the
; dictionary. 

; That makes a big difference to Nahuatl, which has so many varying spelling
; standards. And English may now define "ize" to surface either as <ise> or
; <ize> at the end of a word, which is realised as <is> or <iz> before a vowel.
; In Greenlandic, high vowels regularly become mid vowel before uvular stops and
; this is represented in the orthography.

; To use this feature, type the "segment" in brackets. Use (underlying ...) to
; name the underlying element, and (surface ...) to give the orthographic
; representation. You may use anything else too (excepting (lit) and (flags)).

; Once you have defined all the segments, then elsewhere, you can say:
; (df word
;	(segments n ee saltillo w a tl)
;   (seme (head referential) (person first)))
; Look at the line beginning with (segments ...). This spells <nehuatl>,
; <nehhuatl>, <nēhuatl>, <nêwał>, etc. etc (the many ways I have seen this
; spelt), and the way it does that is by listing the underlying segments by
; name.

; These file define two orthographies:
;  - Classical:    This is much like the Spanish orthography. It was introduced
;                  by Jesuit missionaries apparently
;  - Carochi:      This orthography was developed by the famous grammarian; it
;                  marks vowel length and the saltillo.
