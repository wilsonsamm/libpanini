; This program resovles ambiguities by looking at relationships between the 
; objects in the ontology returned by parsing a text in some language. For
; example, in English, depending on region, the word "rubber" may mean either
; condom or eraser. But in "he's wearing a rubber", it is easy to see which
; interpretation to favour because erasers are not worn.
; Similarly, a sheet may be either a bedsheet or a flat piece of paper, or 
; steel. But in "The old sheets are in the laundry", we tend to think of 
; bedsheets first because those are more commonly found in laundry.

; The way this works is by recursively calling "relation", and these relations 
; describe relations between themselves and other relations. For example, sight:
; the entity that does the seeing is normally a sentient being (i.e., a man can
; see, but a book can not), and the entity which is seen is normally visible 
; (i.e., you can see a beach or a worm, but not a month or fury.). So the 
; relation flagged "see" should: 
; - Increment confidence if the agent is sentient 
; - Increment confidence if the patient is visible 
;
