A baby learns the mother's language better in the mother's arms than in a 
university lecture. But throughout human childhood, communication grows 
progressively more complex. In the same way, PP learns a language better in 
stages. This program facilitates multiple stage machine learning by binding a 
variable to some numerical value.

If you look at panini/learn.c, you will find that the (open) command, which 
learns a morpheme, will not finish executing if another (open) command has 
already been executed. In other words, we may learn either a verb or a 
conjugation at a time, but never both. Otherwise, we would end up producing 
unacceptably many results because even a short word may be split in many 
different ways. This influences what may be learned in any one go.

STAGE 1:
	intransitive clauses.
	basic conjugation.

STAGE 2:
	transitive clauses.
