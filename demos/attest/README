Before you carry on reading, read the README file for the dictionary program, at
least the LEARN section.

This program is designed to take a learned rule, and attest it if it turns out
to apply in the given input.

The point of this is that the learner picks up rules way too easily, thereby
producing rules that are not correct. If it turns out to be correct, then the 
rule is attested. Attesting a rule means copying it to the /usr/tranny/attested/
directory, where it will be picked up next time you recompile the language.
