	This is a program that has been written to showcase libtranny, the 
implementation of Tranny, the natural language parsing concepts. Invoke 
the program by giving it the name of the source language and target
language, plus a sentence in the source language, and if possible you
will be given a translation of the same sentence in the target language.

	Build the program and run the enclosed script for an example of how
this works.
