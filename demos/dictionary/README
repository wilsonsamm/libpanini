These programs generate dictionaries and wordfiles from the installed
tranny languages. All you need to do is run the script, and this will
generate these dictionaries:
	- Ainu to English
	- Swahili to Japanese

and these wordlists (ideal for running through a spellchecker for 
example):
	- Ainu
	- English
	- Swahili
